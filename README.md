# CS12FP HoursTracker

This is my Final Project for my Computer Science 12 course. We have been tasked with creating a product for a member of faculty at school. I have contacted one of the Vice Principals, and we have decided to create a tracker for the hours she spends on certain tasks or at meetings.
